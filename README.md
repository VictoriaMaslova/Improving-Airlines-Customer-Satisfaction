# Improving Customer Satisfaction using Tweets

In Kaggle platform Twitter data contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service"). The data was provided by Kaggle in both CSV and SQLite database here. In this project, I used the SQLite database as the source and analyze the airline tweets to find trends and predict sentiments from reviews. This analysis will help airlines understand what makes their customers happy as well as bring their focus on the services which need improvements/changes. This will help them improve their service, increase customer satisfaction and in turn increase business.

### Airline Sentiment Analysis
I needed to answer below questions:
1. What airline is popular with higher tweet percentage?
2. How does the overall sentiment for each airline look like?

### Predicting Airline Sentiment Based on Reviews

I calculated word frequencies using TF-IDF(Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document). TF-IDF are word frequency scores that try to highlight words that are more interesting, e.g. frequent in a document but not across documents.
- Term Frequency: This summarizes how often a given word appears within a document.
- Inverse Document Frequency: This downscales words that appear a lot across documents.

TF-IDF value is the product of the term frequency and log of inverse document frequency.

The data set is imbalanced with 63% negative reviews and only 16% positive reviews. Hence, I used  SMOTE(synthetic minority oversampling technique). It aims to balance class distribution by randomly increasing minority class examples by replicating them.

SMOTE synthesises new minority instances between existing minority instances. It generates the virtual training records by linear interpolation for the minority class. These synthetic training records are generated by randomly selecting one or more of the k-nearest neighbors for each example in the minority class. After the oversampling process, the data is reconstructed.

## Summary of Results

1. United and US Airways are more popular than American and Southwest airlines as more number of people have tweeted about them. Delta and Virgin America airlines have fewer tweets in comparison.
2. Out of the total sentiment count, United, US Airways and American airlines have substantial negative sentiments. These airlines need to address concerns and take steps to improve their customer satisfaction. Virgin America's sentiments are more balanced, with almost equal number of negative, neutral and positive sentiments.
3. Airlines need to improve their customer services, handle flight cancellations and delays, handle bag issues promptly. On the other hand, airlines seem to be doing great by responding promptly, arriving early, good in-flight services, good customer service, providing help and giving upgrades.
4. Except Delta, the main reason for negative tweets for all other airlines is 'Customer Service' followed by 'late flight'. 'Late flight' is the main reason for Delta. This analysis gives direction to airlines to increase customer satisfaction and hence improve business.
5. Dataset has a higher number of negative tweets indicting that many customers have encountered some problems while traveling. This also indicates that airlines need to take immediate actions to improve customer experience and in turn grow their business.
6. After balancing data with SMOTE, accuracy, precision, recall and f1 scores have improved.
